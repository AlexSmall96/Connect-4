## User Stories
### Site User

As a site user I want to:

- See a visually appealing title that fits the theme of the game
- Recieve clear instrucrtions on how to setup and play the game
- Customise elements of the game such as username
- Recieve clear feedback on the outcome of the game
- Have the ability to replay the game

### Website Owner

As a site owner I want to:

- Express my design ideas freely and creatively
- Add my unique ideas to a game such as customisable usernames
- Write complex logic to ensure the game is fully functional in all play modes
- Showcase my skills and advertise my portfolio

## Features

The features of the site are given below, along with an image and its value to the user.

- By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
- Optionally, add a description of your fork.
- Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.
- Click Create fork.
